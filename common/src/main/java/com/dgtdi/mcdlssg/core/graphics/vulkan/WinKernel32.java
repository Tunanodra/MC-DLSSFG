/**
 * Minimal JNA binding for closing Win32 NT handles.
 *
 * <p>{@code vkGetMemoryWin32HandleKHR} hands the application an NT handle that it owns. Unlike the
 * Linux opaque-FD path -- where {@code glImportMemoryFdEXT} takes ownership of the fd and closes it --
 * {@code glImportMemoryWin32HandleEXT} does <b>not</b> take ownership, so we must close the handle
 * after import. Otherwise one handle leaks per exported texture, and those are recreated on every
 * resize.
 *
 * <p>Only referenced from the Windows interop path, so {@code kernel32} is loaded lazily on Windows
 * only (the {@link #INSTANCE} initializer never runs on other platforms).
