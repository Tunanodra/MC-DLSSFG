/**
 * Runs a task on a dedicated thread with a large stack and blocks until it finishes.
 * <p>
 * Some native upscaler initializers (notably NVIDIA NGX's {@code NVSDK_NGX_VULKAN_Init},
 * which reserves a ~1&nbsp;MB buffer on the stack) need far more stack than HotSpot's
 * 1&nbsp;MB default thread stack provides. When such a call runs directly on the render
 * thread it overflows the stack and the process dies with a bare SIGSEGV inside the NVIDIA
 * driver (no {@code hs_err}). JVMs with larger default stacks (e.g. Azul Zing) happen to
 * survive, which is why the crash looked JVM-vendor specific.
 * <p>
 * Running the initializer on a thread created with an explicit large stack size removes the
 * dependency on {@code -Xss} so DLSS/FSR/XeSS init works on any JVM out of the box.
